            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.<br> 
            These names come from a traditional naming system<br> 
            for people from countries such as the Ivory Coast, Togo and Ghana<br>
            Children are given their first name as a 'day name' <br>
            which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. <br>
            It is one of the most important cultural event held when a <br>
            a child was born and was therefore held with high esteem. <br>
            These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul<br> 
            and character of the person.
